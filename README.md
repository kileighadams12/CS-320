# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I make sure my code is functional by writing unit tests that check both normal and edge cases. In this course, using JUnit helped me verify that each method worked correctly and handled invalid input as expected. I also learned that security means more than passing tests. It involves validating inputs, handling exceptions safely, and protecting data so it is not exposed or misused. Following coding standards and running automated tests helps prevent small issues from turning into bigger problems later on.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by carefully reviewing the requirements and identifying what the user actually wants the program to do. For the Contact Service project, the specific rules, like limiting IDs to 10 characters or enforcing a 10-digit phone number, helped me translate user expectations into code. Writing tests around these rules made sure I was meeting those needs and that the software behaved the same way every time. Thinking from both a developer and a tester perspective helped me stay aligned with the userâ€™s goals.

# How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I begin by understanding the problem and what the final program needs to achieve. I break the work into smaller, manageable parts, usually focusing on what each class or method is responsible for. I like to test as I go since it helps catch mistakes early. Over this course, I learned how design and testing work together. A clear design makes testing easier, and running tests often reveals how strong or weak a design really is.
